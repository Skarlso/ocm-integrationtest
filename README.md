# Open-Component-Model Integration Test

## About this project

This repository runs the OCM integration tests. It installs a local OCI registry, performs various OCM commands and checks for the expected results.

## Requirements and Setup

This project uses Python 3.9+ to run the tests against the [OCM CLI](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm). It is targeted to be executed in a Github action workflow. You can also run the tests locally:

* Install Python 3.9+
* Create a virtual environment, e.g `python -m venv <path-to-your-env>/ocmtest`
* Install pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
* Activate environment: `. <path-to-your-env>/ocmtest/bin/activate`
* Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Install docker
* Install htpasswd
* Install [crane](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/main/cmd/crane/doc/crane.md)
* Create SSL certificates and store them in `./certs` directory (see `create-cert.sh` for instructions [Link](create-cert.sh) (be sure to have a hostname with a fully qualified domain name)
* Create a user for the OCI registry and passwd file: `htpasswd -b -v certs/htpasswd ocmuser <my-secret-password>`
* Set environment variables: `export FDQN_NAME=<Your fully qualified host-name>:4430; export USER_NAME=ocmuser; export PASSWD=<my-secret-password>`
* If you user alternative container runtimes to docker (like e.g. colima) you may need to set DOCKER_HOST env var. e.g.: `export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///Users/<my-user>/.colima/default/docker.sock`
* Run local OCI registry in docker: `./start_docker.sh`
* Build local test binaries: `./build.sh`
* Run tests: `pytest tests`
* Stop and remove container: `./stop_docker.sh`
